<h1 id="identicon-api">Identicon API</h1>
<p>This project stemmed from the need to include dynamic, default
identicons for new users of <a href="http://unum.la/">UNUM</a>. I was
inspired by the amazing work of <a
href="https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon">jdenticon</a>, a javascript
module that allowed the generating of identicons. This project provides
a simple interface to that project.</p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>I strived to make the API as easy to use as possible. Use can look
like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;img</span> <span class="er">src</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;https://identicon-api.herokuapp.com/</span><span class="er">&lt;</span><span class="st">username&gt;/</span><span class="er">&lt;</span><span class="st">size&gt;?format=(svg|png)&quot;</span> <span class="er">alt</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>username</code>: This doesn’t have to be a username, just any
string. Hashing is done server-side using SHA-256.</li>
<li><code>size</code>: This is the size of the image you would like
returned. For now, the API only returns squares, so <code>size</code> is
any natural number.</li>
<li><code>format</code>: This is the format you would like the image
returned in, svg or png. (Default: svg)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>I’d love for you to contribute to the project! Go ahead and submit a
pull request and I’ll be sure to take a look at it. Here are some ideas
to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for more diverse sizes, though this will have to be through
changes to the <a
href="https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon">dmester/jdenticon</a>
repo</li>
<li>Support for different hash functions, specified through the Request
body</li>
</ul>
